We are over 1/3 done with the course!

This week we will be looking at ADTs and BSTs.
These stand for: Abstract Data Types and Binary Search Trees


Admin:
    - You can get the handmarking for lab03 done
        this week or next week
    - Assignment 1 has been released! Hopefully we
        can spend a bit of time looking at it


ADTs:
    - An Abstract Data Type is a type of data type
    where you are given an interface that describes
    how to use it, but you do not need to know
    how it is implemented "underneath the hood".

    - e.g. driving a car
    - e.g. queues and stacks

    - Why is this useful?
        - It allows you to think about problems at a "higher level"
        - It helps split up larger problems


BSTs:
    - Binary Search Trees are a new data type!
    - They aim to solve the problems that arrays
    and linked lists have:
        - Arrays are not dynamic,
            you can't change their size
        - Linked lists do not have random access,
            so you can't perform binary search


Assignment 1:
    - Assignment 1 is about implementing a Set ADT
        using a (balanced) binary search tree
    - There are 5 parts to the assignment
    - My tip is to read through the whole assignment
        before you start, because the way you design
        your data structures is VERY IMPORTANT
    - Also, there are no autotests - you must test your own code
