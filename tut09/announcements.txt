Welcome to week 9!

This week's tutorial and lab is about hash maps.

They are an example of an associative data structure,
and are one of the most important data structures
in technical interviews.

Many languages have some sort of hash map
implemented in it. In COMP2521, we will explore
how they are used and implemented underneath the hood.

Admin:
    - This week's lab is the last one! And there is no
        handmarking component.
    - Handmarking for assignment 1 is also underway.
        Most of this class's handmarking has been done.
        If you have any questions, please feel free to ask
        me during the lab or send me an e-mail.

marks = [ 80, 10, 50, 60, 70 ]
marks[10] =

    "z1234567": 50,
    "z5983242": 60,
