Autocomplete is a feature in which an application
predicts the rest of a word a user is typing.
For example, if a user has typed in "th", then autocomplete
may suggest the words "the", "they", "then", and so on.

Explain how a trie could be used to implement
basic autocomplete, which suggests all possible words.



Users are much more likely to type some words than others, so
ideally autocomplete should suggest more likely words.
For example, if a user has typed "tho", autocomplete should
suggest "though" instead of "thou". How could you extend your
solution so that autocomplete suggests more likely words?
