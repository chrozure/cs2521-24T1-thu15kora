COMP2521 is almost over!

The tutorial content is on heaps and tries, but there
are a lot of other important things to mention.



MyExperience:
    - At 50% response rate, and every 5% after:
        We will reveal the topic and mark value of a randomly chosen exam question
        Topic/mark value of one questions revealed at 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%e, ...

    - At 85% completion rate, Kevin will also shave his head :O

    - I have some snacks this week, which I will pass out to people who complete it


Admin:
    - Assignment 1 marking is finished and your marks should be out.
        Please let me or Callum know if you have any issues.

    - Assignment 2 is due tomorrow at 8pm, good luck :)

    - The lab today will be used for revision, any final handmarking
        and also the exam demo.

    - MyExperience is out!




Final exam:
    - In the lab today, you have the opportunity to do
        do an exam demo, where you experience the exam environment.

    - Who wants to do it?



Heaps:
    - Heaps are an efficient data structure used to implement priority queues

    - You would have seen priority queues before with Dijkstra's algorithm
        or Prim's algorithm. They are like queues, except when you dequeue,
        it returns the number with the most priority, instead of the first value.

    - In this tutorial, we will be looking at max heaps. They have 2 properties:
        - Heap property: the value in each node is greater than or equal to
            the values in its children

        - Completeness property: All levels of the tree must be fully filled, and
            we fill them going left to right.



Revision Kahoot:
    - https://create.kahoot.it/share/comp2521-revision/9b46d3b1-ef58-47b6-8c27-55878d71f610



Q&A:
    - Yes, you should put comments before the functions
        with the functions they give you

    - Yes, you still need to say where you got your code from

    - What do you expect for an 'average' student?

    - The sample exam is the same as every other term

    - There WILL be solutions released at the end of this week.

    - Double pass condition:
        - You have to get an overall mark of 50%
        - You have to get at least 40% on the final exam


Thank you everyone for the great term! Good luck with the exam,
and I wish you all the best in the future :)
