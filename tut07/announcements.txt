Hope you all had a good flexi week :)

This week we will be looking at some graph traversals and problems.

The depth-first search algorithm is arguably one of the most important
algorithms in all of computer science, and both this week's lab and
assignment 2 will involve a lot of graph traversals.

Admin:
    - You can get handmarking done for lab04, lab05 and lab07
    - Assignment 2 has been released, and the lecture
        today gives an overview of what is involved
