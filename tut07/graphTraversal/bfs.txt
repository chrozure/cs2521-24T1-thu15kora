bfs(G, src):
    Input: graph G, vertex src

    create visited array, initialised to false
    create predecessor array, initialised to -1
    create queue Q

    mark src as visited
    enqueue src into Q

    while Q is not empty:
        dequeue v from Q

        for each neighbour w of v:
            if w has not been visited:
                mark w as visited
                set predecessor of w to v
                enqueue w into Q
