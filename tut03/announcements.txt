Welcome to week 3!

In this tutorial we will be mainly focusing on sorting algorithms,
but I would like to go through a question on time complexity
since I did not have much time last week and it's quite important.

Admin stuff:
    - This week is the last week you can get lab01 marked!
    - This week's lab is an interesting one - there is no coding but you
        will instead need to write up a report
    - So, lab03 is fully handmarked, and you have until week 5 to get it handmarked
        but you MUST submit it by next Monday!
    - You can also do lab03 in pairs!


Sorting algorithms:
    - Here is a cool video which helps you visualise and
        maybe even audiolize sorting algorithms:
