Welcome to week 8, hope you all had a good Easter!

This week is the last week on graphs. We will be doing
some more graph traversals, Dijkstra's Algorithm
and then look at Minimum Spanning Trees

I will also spend a little bit of time looking through assignment 2.

Admin:
    - As always, there is handmarking to be done for
        labs 5, 7, and 8
    - The automarking for assignment 1 has been completed.
        IMPORTANT: Please check your auto-mark, and check
        if you have lost marks due to efficiency.
        If you did lose some marks and you are sure of it,
        create a private forum post
